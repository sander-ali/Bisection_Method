# Bisection_Method
This MATLAB code is for Bisection Method with the number of iterations as stopping criteria.

You need to change the function value in f.m in order to find the roots using bisection method. 

The output includes the mid-points in the first column and the absolute errors in the second column.

out = mybisection(x1,x2,n);
